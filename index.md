## Areas of Reference 000s - 
	- [[000 Index]] 
	- [[010 Productivity]] 
	- [[020 Family Life]]
	- [[030 Software Development]]
	- [[040 Science]]
	- [[050 Machine Learning]]
	- [[060 Business]]
	- [[070 Content Creation]]
	- [[080 Psychology and philosophy]]
	- [[090 TODO]]

So the idea is that these references are representing my major focus areas in
life. Then within those reference notes there will be MOCs. MOC is short for
maps of content which is essentially a curation of content within a reference.
In other words it will show me where some good jump of points could be within
for example productivity in case i want to think more about some topic within
productivity.

Futhermore to build upon the reference system all references I will tag with
#🏛  will also have a link to these index areas of focus if possible so that i
can find everything i have read related to for example Machine learning etc. 

I will be using tags for status and type of note for now, I think that will be
the most useful system for it, maybe even use emojis as tags. The "tags" will
be links so that MOC's can emerge and this will give structures over time. The
conventional idea for a tag will be used for status

tags: 
	- :🌳: this is the evergreen notes, this means that notes with this
	  symbol are fleshed out and will always give value when i read them
	  even years after they are written
	- :🗺: MOC for notes that are maps of content
	- :🌱: New ideas and notes that are not done yet or need more fleshing
	  out but they are notes with refernces and they can be somewhat
	  understood later on, and the general content is written as if someone
	  else should understand it
	- :📖: Literature notes, these will be notes from books I read or notes
	  while listening to video lectures such as huberman or the meaning
	  crisis series. The idea is that i will process these into new ideas
	  and eventually make them into evergreen notes. 
	- :🏛: wiki notes/reference bibliography. Notes with this tag are just
	  straight facts or general concepts like calculus that I will use as
	  reference for my permanent/evergreen notes later on.
	- :📬: inbox. Fleeting notes will have this status and this means that
	  these notes are just thoughts/ideas I find interesting that i have
	  had during the day and these have to be fleshed out or thrown away at
	  the end of the day.
