## Libraries and tools for building GenAI applications
- Ollama: Local LLM inference, local API to use the LLM
- Smolagents: Lightweight agents framework for building AI applications in
  python
- MLX: Apple silicon specific pythhon library for fine-tuning and running LLMs.
  Can be imported as a python module to send calls to the locally running LLM
- LM Studio: Essentially a GUI for using models locally.
- Litellm: Python library for working with LLMs and building apps by using the
  openai style. So its like a unified api to talk to all llms through rest. 
- MCP Inspector: Used for inspecting and debugging MCP calls. Very useful when
  building agents that use MCP to debug and look at the communication that
  actually takes place between the MCP and the llm

## General ecosystem hubs and resources
- Hugginface: Hub for oss-models, datasets and dev tools
