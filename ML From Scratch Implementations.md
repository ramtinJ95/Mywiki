Projects I want to go through and implement:

  this playlist is legendary, should follow along with a different language
    maybe rust or c++ to practice those languages. ( Monologe: Probably worth it to do it
    with both, but start with c++ since I know that language much better and
    also its good practice for my graphics projects. Then once that is done I
    could re-implement from notes and memory in rust to really test my
    understanding.)
