My master document for which tools and frameworks im using to manage my
productivity.

__Obligaton/status list (NOT a todo list):__
Anything that I have commited to do so that I do not forget. This is not a task
list so no actual tasks need to go here. Also the second column so to speak of
this list should be the status of this obligation. For example the status could
be waiting to hear back from person x about this, backburner, urgent etc. And if
any new info regarding an obligation pops up or status changes etc then it can
just be added to that item in the list. Trello sounds like a perfect tool for
this where columns are statuses and the cards are the items on the list.

__Multi scale planning:__
Quarterly plans
Weekly plans
daily plan should be analog notebook, in my case remarkable will be perfect.

__Pull based workflow:__
For each day create a list of things where the top 3 are the things that im
actively working on. Anything else should be added to the bottom of the list and
once one item in the top 3 is done then the next thing in the queue gets moved
up. So we pull stuff into our window of 3 things that we are going to work on. 

__Shutdown ritual:__
Before going home for the day, make sure there are no loose threads or anything
urgent not done that should have been done. Also spend some time to get a sense
of what tomorrows daily plan should be. Dont need to finish the planning for
tomorrow but should have a good idea. Also write down the context and any ideas
thoughts that you think will be useful tomorrow. To help with getting a sense of
what to do tomorrow look at your weekly plan and add a little note about what
you did that day. Here you can also revise the weekly plan if needed. Once this
is all done, to finish of the workday say the phrase" Work day over, see you
again tomorrow" to make it clear that no more work related stuff will be done or
thought about until tomorrow. 

__Fixed work schedule:__
This essentially means that the daily work that is to be done is divided into
blocks. And the only thing you should be doing during that block is whatever
that block is, if its coding then its coding, if it is communicating on slack
then that is that. If it is a coding block you should not be looking at slack or
email etc because that is for the communication block. 


## Learning
use [Anki](Anki) for spaced repetition
use active recall, that is to read something like a chapter etc and then try to
write down what I remember and build up the knowledge i just gained from scratch
without looking at the book as if im going to give a lecture on it.
use a pen and notebook always when reading. Active reading is where actual
learning and digestion of the content of a book happens.
