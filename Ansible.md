Ansible can be used as a solo dev or in big and small orgs to manage many
different installs of servers or computers. I will be using Ansible to bootstrap
all the software that I am used to using and that I have config files for. This
pared with [[Chezmoi]] should make it super easy to replicate my dev env accross
multiple machines.
