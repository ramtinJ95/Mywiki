##### Chapter 2: Understanding Foundational Models

- Picking out the most common output among a set of outputs can be especially
  useful for tasks that expect exact answers.
- To get a model to give structured output we can give it instructions i.e
  prompting. We can do that and some manual post-processsing where we have a
  script etc fix small mistakes. We can also do something called constrain
  sampling. This is expensive and non-trivial. Finetuning is the best bang for
  your buck approach to get the expected output. But as modles get better at
  following instructions prompting will probably be enough in the future
