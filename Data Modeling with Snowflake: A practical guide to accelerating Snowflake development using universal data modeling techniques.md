## Notes
- Hybrid Unistore tables (what the f are these?)
- Service layer in snowflake as 2 types: Metadata chache and query result
chache. Look into these. 
- Transient tables. Seem ideal for development environment and stage tables
- Task in snowflake combined with stream objects seem to be good when thinking
about CDC piopelines.
