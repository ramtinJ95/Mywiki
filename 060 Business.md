The philosophy to live by currently:
Businesses, especially big businesses, are
just people with a problem. The nice thing is they’re not spending their 
personal money so they’re more flexible. If you want to take over their 
billing system, that is a huge project and will take lots of meetings and 
time and you’ll fight huge companies. So focus on a small problem those 
people have - keeping track of one single resource, updating printer drivers,
a desktop pop-up notification when the printer is low on ink, etc, etc. 
A $1 million market is too small for big businesses to chase but can make you 
quite comfortable.
