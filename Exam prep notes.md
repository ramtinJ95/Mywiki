# AWS cloud practioner exam practice notes 

what is an active disaster recovery strategy?

from practise test it looks like there is quite a bit of focus on EC2.

what is AWS AMI? this one has came up a couple of times.

Inspector is mostly used for checking security of containers.

### AWS Lightsail and AWS Batch
Amazon Lightsail is designed to be the easiest way to launch and manage a virtual private server with AWS. Lightsail plans include everything you need to
jumpstart your project – a virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP address – for a low, predictable price.
AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to easily and efficiently run hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS. AWS Batch
dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources (e.g., CPU or memory-optimized instances) based on the volume and specific resource
requirements of the batch jobs submitted.

### AWS Well-Architected Framework
- __Operational Excellence__: The ability to support development and run workloads
  effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continously improve
  supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.
- __Security__: The security pillar describes how to take advantage of cloud tech to protect
  data, systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security posture.
- __Reliability__: The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its
  intended function correctly and consistently when its expected to. This
  includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total
  lifecycle.
- __Performance Efficiency__: The ability to use computing resources efficiently
  to meet systems requirments, and to maintain that efficency as demand
  changes and tech evoles.
- __Cost Optimization__: The ability to run systems to deliver business value at
  the lowest price point.
- __Sustainability__: The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts
  by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all
  components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the benefits from
  the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.
