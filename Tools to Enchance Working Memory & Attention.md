Working memory is memory that we use just when we are doing things that we dont
want to remember like tying our shoes while we think about work. The steps of
tying our shoes is then loaded into working memory and then discared when we
move on to the next step of our day. 

3 letters remembered in the first working memory test

The two important brain structures when it comes to working memory is the
prefrontal cortex and the neurons in the brain stem that manifacture dopamine
and has their axons going into the prefrontal cortex and realising dopaimine.
This is called the mesial corcidal system. 

The amount to which this mesial cordical system realses dopamine per unit of
time, dictates if working memory is going to be high or low. With this being
said it is important to note that it is not the case that increasing the amount
of dopamine increases working memory. We can imagine the effect of dopamine on
working memory to work as a inverted U-shaped curve. Because studies have found
that those that have 

Managed to remember 4 words from the working memory test and that means high
working memory span. 

working memory is the composition of being able to ignore distractions and task
switching. 

Good ways of increasing dopamine realease in the brain and thus improving
attention and working memory.
1) Yoga nidra or Non-sleep deep rest
2) Cold showers or cold water plunge preferably.
3) bi-neural beats dont increase dopamine but has been shown to increase the
   performance of working memory.
4) supplements: L-tyrosine 0.5g - 1,5g recommend dose, Mucuna Pruriens. If going
   down this path of introducing more dopamine through pharmacology then know
   that people that have done this report experiencing a drop in alertness and
   general mood 3-4 hours after ingesting these doses of dopamine. This is why
   the behavioural therapies are prefered because they increase dopamine slower
   and it tapers of much slower and has longer lasting effects.
