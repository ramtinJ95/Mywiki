### Notes
- Having skip level meetings where I have meetings with my boss's boss will
  allow for more big picture impact and more importantly impact
- Your job is to make the organization succesfull
- The three maps approach:
  - Locator map: Your place in the org. This help one maker sure the teams one
    works with understand their purpose in the org, who their cusomers are, how
    their work affects people.
  - Toplogical map: Highlight friction and gaps between teams and open up the
    paths of communication.
  - Treasure map: Helps one make suer everyone knows exactly what they are
    trying to achieve and why.
- page 48 the difference between bottom up and top-down companies and how to
  approach both.
- You know the story you are telling and the vision you are selling is well
  received and understood when decisions are being taken in the right direciton
  without your direct involvement.
- Put non-meetings in the calendar too. Do not just call it focus time but
  rather you should write out exactly what it is that you are going to bbe
  doing.
- page 184 Squarespace staff engeineer example is excellent.
- All in all a good book. I took what I can apply at my level which is not at
  staff. But much of the book is not relevant at my level yet so this book is
  worth revisiting at a later date for sure.
