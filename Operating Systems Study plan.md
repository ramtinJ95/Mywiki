## Study plan
Reading three pieces book is step one.

After that there are some detailed books which I will read such as:
- Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
- Operating System Concepts by Abraham Silberschatz.
  This book also has a companion website and is taught at yale: https://os-book.com/OS10/index.html
